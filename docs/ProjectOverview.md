# Project Overview

## 1. System Objectives

### What problem are you solving?
The agricultural sector faces significant challenges in connecting farmers directly with buyers, leading to price opacity, reduced margins for farmers, and limited access to market information. Traditional supply chains often involve multiple intermediaries, resulting in farmers receiving lower prices while buyers pay higher costs.

### Who benefits and how?
- **Farmers**: Gain direct access to buyers, improved price transparency, and higher margins through reduced intermediaries
- **Buyers**: Access to verified, quality produce with transparent pricing and reliable delivery
- **Marketplace Admins**: Comprehensive tools for monitoring marketplace health, managing disputes, and ensuring compliance
- **Agricultural Community**: Access to localized farming tips, price bulletins, and seasonal advisories for better decision-making

## 2. Proposed Scope

### Modules/systems to integrate:
- **Authentication & Authorization**: User registration, login, role-based access control
- **User Management**: Profile management, verification, and account administration
- **Product Catalog**: Listing management, inventory tracking, and search functionality
- **Order Management**: Cart, checkout, order lifecycle, and status tracking
- **Payment Processing**: Integration with payment gateways for secure transactions
- **Logistics Integration**: Delivery request handling and tracking
- **Notification System**: In-app, email, and SMS notifications
- **Content Management**: Price bulletins and farming tips hub
- **Review & Rating System**: Feedback mechanism for trust building
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Admin dashboards and business intelligence

### In-scope features for Lab 1–3:
- Core user authentication and role management
- Basic product listing and search functionality
- Order placement and payment processing
- Essential notification system
- Basic admin dashboard

### Out-of-scope (for now):
- Advanced analytics and AI-driven recommendations
- Mobile application development
- Advanced logistics optimization
- Multi-language support
- Advanced dispute resolution automation

## 3. Stakeholders

- **Farmers** — Need to list products, manage inventory, receive orders, and get fair pricing
- **Buyers** — Need to search products, place orders, make payments, and track deliveries
- **Marketplace Admins** — Need to verify users, moderate content, manage disputes, and monitor system health
- **Payment Gateway Providers** — Need to process secure transactions and provide confirmation services
- **Logistics Providers** — Need to receive delivery requests and provide tracking information
- **Agricultural Extension Offices** — Need to provide farming tips and market price information
- **System Administrators** — Need to maintain system performance, security, and compliance

## 4. Tools & Technologies

### Languages/Frameworks:
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript for responsive web interface
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js or Python with Django/FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for caching
- **Mobile**: React Native (future consideration)

### Integration approach:
- **REST APIs**: Primary communication protocol between services
- **Webhooks**: Real-time event notifications to external services
- **Message Queue**: Asynchronous processing for notifications and background tasks
- **API Gateway**: Centralized API management and rate limiting

### Repos/Services:
- **Version Control**: GitHub for source code management
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment
- **Cloud Platform**: AWS or Azure for hosting and infrastructure
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring and logging services

### Testing tools:
- **Unit Testing**: Jest (JavaScript) or pytest (Python)
- **Integration Testing**: Supertest for API testing
- **End-to-End Testing**: Cypress or Playwright
- **Load Testing**: Artillery or k6 for performance testing

### Additional Tools:
- **Documentation**: Markdown with automated API documentation
- **Security**: OAuth 2.0 for authentication, JWT for authorization
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe or PayPal for payment processing
- **Notification Services**: SendGrid for email, Twilio for SMS
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage for images and documents
